Battle against other players to rank up!

In KitPvP, players will have a massive selection of kits to choose from! Once you choose which kit you want to fight with, you can jump down and fight your friends. Each kit has its own advantages and disadvantages. You will need lots of skill to overcome those disadvantages, and utilize those advantages to their utmost potential! Compete against your friends to become the best PvPer, or fight long and hard to become the #1 PvPer on the server!
